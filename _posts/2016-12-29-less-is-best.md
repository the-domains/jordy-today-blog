  I’ve recently started the journey toward minimalism! I’ve reduced all of my
  clothing down to 30 items. I’ve also purged all of my electronics that I don’t
  need. It’s been hard! Although, I must say it gave me great joy to finally rid
  myself of that damn cable box with all the adapters and chargers for devices I
  no longer even have!
